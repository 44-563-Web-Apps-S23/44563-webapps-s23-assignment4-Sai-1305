        LANE. What's the matter?

        MRS. BAUER. [_Dully._] Huh?

        LANE. [_Significantly._] Oh, I know.

        MRS. BAUER. What you know?

        LANE. About the boss. [MRS. BAUER _looks distressed_.] Heard your friends across the street talkin'.

        MRS. BAUER. [_Bitterly._] Friends!

        LANE. Rotten trick to play on the boss, all right, puttin' that old maid up to get him pinched.

        MRS. BAUER. [_Absently._] Was she an old maid?

        LANE. The cruelty-to-animals woman over there [_waves his hand_]--regular old crank. Nies[H] put her up to it all right.

        MRS. BAUER. I guess it was his old woman. Nies ain't so bad. She's the one. Because my two boys dress up a little on Sunday, she don't like it.

        LANE. Yes, she's sore because the boys told her the boss kicks their dog.
