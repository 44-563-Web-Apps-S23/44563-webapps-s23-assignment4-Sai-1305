        <p>What's the matter?</p>

        <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> 
        <p>[_Dully._]</p>
        <p>Huh?</p>

        <h6>LANE.</h6> 
        <p>[_Significantly._]</p>
        <p>Oh, I know.</p>

        <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> 
        <p>What you know?</p>

        <h6>LANE.</h6> 
        <p>About the boss.</p>
        <p>[MRS. BAUER _looks distressed_.]</p>
        <p>Heard your friends across the street talkin'.</p>

        <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> 
        <p>[_Bitterly._]</p>
        <p>Friends!</p>

        <h6>LANE.</h6> 
        <p>Rotten trick to play on the boss, all right, puttin' that old maid up to get him pinched.</p>

        <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> 
        <p>[_Absently._]</p>
        <p>Was she an old maid?</p>

        <h6>LANE.</h6> 
        <p>The cruelty-to-animals woman over there</p>
        <p>[_waves his hand_]</p>
        <p>--regular old crank. Nies[H] put her up to it all right.</p>

        <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> 
        <p>I guess it was his old woman. Nies ain't so bad. She's the one. Because my two boys dress up a little on Sunday, she don't like it.</p>

        <h6>LANE.</h6> 
        <p>Yes, she's sore because the boys told her the boss kicks their dog.</p>
